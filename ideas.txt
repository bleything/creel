- add plugin system
    - Creel is a basic app that knows how to capture a given payload and
      try to deserialize it and stash in mongo
    - plugins can be written that know how to deserialize a particular
      service's hooks
        - maybe have plugins inherit from Creel but implement a special
          method that can decompose a POST body and return it as a hash?
    - plugins are mounted at specific URL spaces in the config.ru:
        map( '/'         ) { run Creel           }
        map( '/github'   ) { run Creel::GitHub   }
        map( '/sendgrid' ) { run Creel::Sendgrid }
    - provide migration path that can reprocess all hooks received by
      regular Creel before a plugin was installed
